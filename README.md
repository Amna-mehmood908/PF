##Overview OF MY PROJECT
The Student Management System is a console-based application built using C++ that allows users to efficiently manage student records. This system enables users to add, display, search, update, and delete student information in a structured and user-friendly manner.

This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as arrays, loops, functions, conditional statements, and file handling to maintain student data dynamically.
